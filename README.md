# 05-Space-shooter
My first shooter. Was able to add a victory and defeat screen. The enemies spawn in random locations and also fire back. Both mouse buttons fire a cannon. Also tried to give it a matching outer space color palette. Used the bullet exercize as a template and added in to fill the gaps. Found assets on kenney.nl and background from wallpaper-house.
